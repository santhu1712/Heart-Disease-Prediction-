## üìñ About the Project
The **Heart Disease Prediction App** is designed to assess whether a person might be at risk of heart disease based on clinical and lifestyle attributes.  
It uses a dataset from the **UCI Machine Learning Repository** and a trained machine learning model (e.g., Logistic Regression) to make predictions.

This project is intended for **educational and awareness purposes only**, not as a medical diagnosis tool.

## üõ† Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Handle missing values  
   - Encode categorical variables  
   - Perform feature scaling if necessary  

2. **Feature Selection**  
   - Correlation analysis  
   - Feature importance techniques  

3. **Model Selection & Training**  
   - Algorithm: Logistic Regression (or other ML models)  
   - Split dataset into train & test sets  
   - Train model on selected features  

4. **Model Evaluation**  
   - Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score  
   - Cross-validation for generalization check  

5. **Hyperparameter Tuning**  
   - Grid Search / Random Search for optimization  

6. **Deployment**  
   - Save trained model as `.pkl` file  
   - Build a **Streamlit** UI for predictions
